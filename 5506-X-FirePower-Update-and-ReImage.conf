! --- ASDM ---

! Always prefer ASDM if you only want to update FirePower - its so much easier (for this update)

! --- CLI ---

! Use CLI if you want to update and re-image FirePower

! Requirements:
! A Boot Image file (i.e. asasfr-5500x-boot-6.2.0-2.img) - download from Cisco.
! A Firepower Software Package (i.e. asasfr-sys-6.0.0-1005.pkg) this is a BIG file (over a Gigabyte) - download from Cisco.
! A Web Server, (or FTP server) setup, with the files above available for 'download' into the FirePOWER module.
! I prefer filezilla server with a anonymous user for the file exchange

!!! Check that the management port ist not shut !!!
! Just follow the steps in the source above
